          <p>
            I’m Thomas Kabelo Ndlovu, a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology graduate from North-West University. My fascination with technology began at an early age, rooted in a natural curiosity about how things work beneath the surface — from simple mobile apps to complex information systems. Over the years, that curiosity has matured into a genuine passion for designing intelligent, secure, and efficient digital solutions.

My academic background has provided me with a solid foundation in key areas of IT, including software development, automation, data management, and cybersecurity. I’ve gained practical experience working with multiple programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, and C#, and I regularly use SQL for managing and querying relational databases. I also have hands-on experience with UiPath for process automation, as well as Git and GitHub for version control and collaborative development.

I approach learning as a continuous and practical process. In a field that evolves as rapidly as technology, staying current isn't just a requirement—it's a lifestyle. I’m constantly exploring new tools, frameworks, and ideas, whether through online courses, academic projects, or independent experimentation. My interests span a wide spectrum, from full-stack development and system architecture to machine learning and digital security.

Beyond the screen, I value structure, clarity, and creative problem-solving. I enjoy breaking down complex challenges and building solutions that are not only functional but also scalable and secure. I’m now eager to bring my technical skills, collaborative mindset, and passion for innovation to a dynamic team where I can contribute, grow, and continue making an impact.
